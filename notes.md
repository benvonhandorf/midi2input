trying to hold back the stream of consciousness is annoying, so here it goes.

using the plugin system for midi2input is tempting as i can choose already
between one of two possibilities, being alsa and jack, and then later on
perhaps i can make it support other various plugins, perhaps the systemtray
applet can be part of the plugin host

* system tray
* alsa midi
* jack midi
* dbus
* avahi connection host
* connection dialog
* quick event mapping tool
* network midi receive
* phone application
* proper support of midi
* support for OSC
* support for regular input devices

things i would like to see is to actually turn a keyboard into a midi
controller not just map the keys, but use an alternative driver to talk to the
kernel to make it think it its a device, xy controls from trackpad or
touchscreen or mouse etc.
