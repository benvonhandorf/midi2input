Looks like this project is pre-diary, which is interesting. All newer things I
create have a Diary to use as a thought dump.

Anyway, Today I decided to take a look at where this stands, I've had a few
interested parties over the years, but they as expected come and go, I would
like perhaps to make this friendlier to updating with features that make sense.

But mainly I wish to perform some maintenance more than anything, it's been a
while and that can be informative.
