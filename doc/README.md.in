[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/enetheru/midi2input.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/enetheru/midi2input)

This program takes midi events from jackd and translates them to input events.
Configuration is written in Lua it doesnt matter if i break spaces with this so
long as it gets done right

**Requires:**
  * X11 with the XTest extension
  * jack audio connection it
  * lua

**Features:**
  * ability to map events from midi device to keyboard and mouse
  * per application maps, based on currently focused application
  * default fallback map
  * input maps are programmed in lua.
  * ability to send midi events to the controller, for control of led buttons, etc

**Why?:**<br>
Because I had a midi controller, and I thought it was a shame that I could not control my pc using it. I did a little research online and it didnt seem that there was an existing solution that fit my needs, indeed I didnt find a solution at all that was FLOSS.
